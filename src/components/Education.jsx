        <p>As i told you above here i am a  <strong>self taught</strong>, my educational journey began at the elementary level in "Lij-Seyoum" public school until 2017. During my high school years at "Andarge" private school until 2021, I delved into web development through online resources, particularly YouTube and various websites. Despite lacking a formal degree, my passion for frontend development led me to acquire comprehensive skills and knowledge. Currently enrolled at Microlink IT College, I continue to enhance my expertise. My journey underscores a commitment to continuous learning, self-motivation, and the practical application of skills gained through hands-on experience.</p>
